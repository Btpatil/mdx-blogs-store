# The Ultimate Guide: How to Download YouTube ReVanced App

## Introduction:

YouTube has revolutionized the way we consume video content, offering a vast library of videos on almost every topic imaginable. However, the official YouTube app sometimes falls short when it comes to providing a personalized and ad-free experience. 

If you are searching for the Youtube ReVanced then you might already know about the famous Youtube Vanced, and if you know about Vanced then you already know that it got BANNED!! Well that is to say, it discontinued getting any further updates. Well worry not because that's where YouTube ReVanced comes in, carrying the legacy of the Youtube Vanced. 

YouTube ReVanced is a modified version of the YouTube app that offers enhanced features such as ad-blocking, background playback, and more customization options. In this blog post, we'll guide you through the process of downloading YouTube ReVanced. I will give you two methods by which you can get your own Youtube ReVanced App. 
So without wasting any more of your time, LET'S GET STARTED!!!

## Method 1: By using ReVanced Manager:
This method is my favourite. It allows me to manually and fully customize the youtube however I like. It gives the granular control of what features you want in youtube and what features you don't want. It just excites me to fiddle around with the youtube. 
If you are a geek or Android enthusiast then you would definetly like this method and you should go with this method. It's totally recommended from my side.

### Step 3: Patching the downloaded youtube apk file
The next step is to patch the YouTube APK using the ReVanced Manager. Follow the below steps for the patching APK:
1. Open the <b>ReVanced Manager app -> Click on the Patcher button -> click on the Select an application option -> click om the storage button -> select the downloaded youtube apk file</b>
2. Click on the Select patches option
3. You can manually select the patches/features you want for your ReVanced Youtube app. If you manually choose the preferred patches, ensure that the microG support patch is enabled to make sure you can sign into your Google account. If you ask me i would say just click on the recommended/default option, because those are the most stable patches from which hopefully you won't come across any errors.
4. Choose Done when you're done selecting the required patches
5. After selecting the required patches, click the <b>Patch</b> button at the bottom right corner to start the patching process. Be patient as it will take around 10-15 minutes depending on the performance of your device. 
6. After the patching process is completed, i would recommend you to export the apk by clicking on the 3 dots on the top right corner, just to be safe as sometimes if by chance install button gets disappears before installing then you would need to do the whole patching process all over again. Once exporting is done, click on the Install button at the bottom right corner and select Install again in the app installation prompt. (If you get a warning prompt from Play Protect to prevent ReVanced installation, click the Install Anyway button to proceed with the installation.)
4. Your Youtube ReVanced is now installed on your device!!
